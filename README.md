# Vibration
- This is based in a study case to Binahki. 
- The data related witha a small motor (Power: 250W) whose vibrational stated in axis $(x,y,z)$ are measured with acelerometer sensors.
- The main data are in the ./Data/Dados de Vibração e Temperatura directory. Also you can find them in a zipped .rar archive.
  - The title of these archives which are for instance: "1658832447 - 1658832513.csv" corresponds to the time spended collecting the data. There's about one minute on any archive and about one hour to between one archive and other.
